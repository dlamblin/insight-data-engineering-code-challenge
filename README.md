Insight Data Engineering Code Challenge
==========

Versions:

- Perl
- Java

Perl
----
The Perl version was quick and easy to make.
It does not drop numbers as non-words, but that's not hard to add.
I just wanted to show the quickest basic solution, with the full caveat that it is not clean, well documented nor scalable.

Java
----
This would be the readme documentation. More on that later.
